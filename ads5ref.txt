First Slide
-----------
Welcome to our little guide to the asciidoc s5 backend. This reference is supposed to contain the knowledge required to create slides with asciidoc and to contain all s5 elements available through the backend. Have fun reading it.

In creating the backend we tried to match s5 markup to AsciiDoc conventions as best as we could. If you still think there are improvements possible we'd love to hear from you.

Frontpage Attributes
--------------------
.default document attributes
* *doctitle* - title of the slide
* *date* - date of the presentation

.named attributes
* *subtitle* - subtitle of the presentation
* *author* - author of the presentation
* *company* - company the author represents

Keep in mind that attributes will be escaped prior to insertion. So make sure to write +++{lt}+++, +++{gt}+++, and +++{amp}+++ instead of their single character equivalents.

Behaviour Attributes
--------------------
* *header* - text placed at the top of the page
* *footer* - text placed at the bottom of the page
* *theme* - directory containing the required js and css, default +ui/default+
* *defaultview* - state the slide starts in, either +slideshow+ or +outline+, default +slideshow+
* *controlvis* - visibility of the controls, either +visible+ or +hidden+, default +hidden+

Some themes defines special markup for the header and footer (i.e. h1 as lower left and h2 as lower right block inside the footer). Have a look at the style definition or an example for the specific theme.

emptyslide
----------
It is possible to create Slides without a title by using an +emptyslide+ special section.

About
-----
The s5 AsciiDoc configuration came into being because Jan Christoph Ebersbach decided he was fed up of writing s5 presentations with Markdown and Wolfgang Machert decided he was fed up of writing presentations using OpenOffice/Docbook-slides.

And since they both just started to become AsciiDoc addicts (simply because everyone else and their mom was already writing their diploma-thesis in latex, which made it kinda uncool doing the same) they both agreed that it would be nice writing them in this new toy of theirs.

Well, the rest of this story is already at your harddrive...

Changeset
---------
* started ads5 reference
* replaced css from conf with html tags, cleaned up the markup
* version metatag reversed to markup version (previous version was based in misunderstanding of the spec)
* fixed attribute substitution bugs in header (equal sign instead of question mark)
* fixed case of defaultview and controlvis attribute
* fixed header and footer defaults
* added emptyslide section and theme attribute
