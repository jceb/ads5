First Slide
-----------
Welcome to our little guide to the asciidoc s5 backend. This reference is
supposed to contain the knowledge required to create slides with asciidoc and to
contain all s5 elements available through the backend. Have fun reading it.

In creating the backend we tried to match s5 markup to AsciiDoc conventions as
best as we could. If you still think there are improvements possible we'd love
to hear from you.

Frontpage Attributes
--------------------
.default document attributes
* *doctitle* - title of the slide
* *date* - date of the presentation

.named attributes
* *subtitle* - subtitle of the presentation
* *author* - author of the presentation
* *organization* - organization the author represents

Keep in mind that attributes will be escaped prior to insertion. So make sure to
write +++{lt}+++, +++{gt}+++, and +++{amp}+++ instead of their single character
equivalents.

Behaviour Attributes
--------------------
* *header* - text placed at the top of the page
* *footer* - text placed at the bottom of the page
* *theme* - directory containing the required js and css, default +ui/default+
* *defaultview* - state the slide starts in, either +slideshow+ or +outline+, default +slideshow+
* *controlvis* - visibility of the controls, either +visible+ or +hidden+, default +hidden+
* *transitions* (1.3) - transitions, default +false+
* *fadeduration* (1.3) - transitions, default +500+
* *incrduration* (1.3) - transitions, default +250+
* *automatic* (1.3) - transitions, default +false+
* *playloop* (1.3) - transitions, default +true+
* *playdelay* (1.3) - transitions, default +10+
* *audiosupport* (1.3) - transitions, default +false+
* *audiovolume* (1.3) - transitions, default +100+
* *audioerror* (1.3) - transitions, default +false+
* *audiodebug* (1.3) - transitions, default +false+

Some themes defines special markup for the header and footer (i.e. h1 as lower
left and h2 as lower right block inside the footer). Have a look at the style
definition or an example for the specific theme.

emptyslide
----------
It is possible to create Slides without a title by using an +emptyslide+ special section.

About
-----
The s5 AsciiDoc configuration came into being because Jan Christoph Ebersbach
decided he was fed up of writing s5 presentations with Markdown and Wolfgang
Machert decided he was fed up of writing presentations using
OpenOffice/Docbook-slides.

And since they both just started to become AsciiDoc addicts (simply because
everyone else and their mom was already writing their diploma-thesis in latex,
which made it kinda uncool doing the same) they both agreed that it would be
nice writing them in this new toy of theirs.

Well, the rest of this story is already at your harddrive...
